#Add some content reflecting on what you've learned about Python so far
I just finished working through the Python 3 course on Codecademy, and it really helped me get a feel for the basics. I’ve been practicing things like loops, functions, and handling input. The hands-on exercises made it easier to understand how code actually runs. While I can write basic programs, I don’t yet have a deep understanding of how to apply the concepts I’ve learned. I’m hoping this course will help build the foundation I’ve been missing.
