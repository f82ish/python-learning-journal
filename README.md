A repository to document my Python learning journey

#About Me
I have been practicing with Python for a couple of months now. So far, I actually think it's pretty fun.

#Goals for This Course
I hope to grasp a better, deeper understanding of the fundamentals of Python. I'm a firm believer that you can only build as strong as your foundation will allow.

#My First Python Program
#Print the statement Hello, World!
print("Hello, World!")
